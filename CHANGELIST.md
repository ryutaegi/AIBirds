### List of Changes (release alpha v0.6.6)
1. Extend *66 Report Novelty Likelihood* request to accept reported prediction of novelty hierarchy. For each of 9 hierarchy levels (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8): A decimal value in the range [0,1] with 2-digit precision. Detailed format is in description of request 66 in README.md. The python agent has a demo code of how this works in src/demo/naive_agent_groundtruth.py and src/client/agent_client.py. 
2. Fixed novelty L38T10-14 wind appears late in high sim speed issue

### List of Changes (release alpha v0.6.5)

    L37T20 The butterfly adds health points to the pigs nearby 
    L38T10-14 A time triggered storm that applies force to the left of the flying birds
    L38T20-24 A long wood object that will destroy itself when a bird collides with any object

2. Added a new NoveltyHint Command (72) that returns different levels of novelty hints in JSON object. It only works for hint level 1 (hint levels shown below as a reference).

  Hint hierarchy:
  Type 0: level of novelty in novelty hierarchy
  Type 1: specify “thing” that changed (e.g., which object, action, relation)
  Type 2: specify which attribute of the “thing” has changed or what has changed (e.g., gravity)
  Type 3: what is the value of the changed attribute, how has it changed?

The symbolic groundtruth will be set to devmode where novel object is labeled as "novel_object"
The input and output format is in README.md

### List of Changes (release alpha v0.5.14)

  - The maximal number of ground truths recorded is 200
  - The recording will also stop if no object in the scene is moving
  - If the game is paused, it will be resumed at the beginning of the recording
  - The game will be paused after the recording is finished
3. Fixed a bug: the game will not be resumed after the mouse scroll operation or zoom in/out request  
4. The old novelty examples are added back
### List of Changes (release alpha v0.5.0)
1. Changed request 38, shoot and record batch ground as below:
  - added an optional parameter to let the TA2 agent specify how the batch ground truth can be collected. 0 is the default value.
    -- there are two options in this version: 1. record full ground truths (at most 200 frames); 2. only record the ground truths during the bird flying before the tap or the first collision between the bird and another object.
  - the game will be paused after the game scene is stable or 200 frames of ground truths have been recorded
  - the game will be resumed when receiving another shooting command
2. Reduced position noise level to at most +-1 pixel
3. Fixed the trajectory dots issue in the game and ground truth
4. The time interval between two consective ground truths in a batch is consistent now 
5. Level loading actions do not count as interactions any more
6. Added warning message in the game log when trying to shoot while game is not in playing state. There will be no batch ground truth returned in such situation.
7. Fixed bug with colour map noise. The noise to the colour percentage was not applied correctly. Now each 'percentage' of the colour will have a 1% noise.
8. Adapted naive agent to the new batch gt request
9. Updated the implementation 
10. Added four external agents:
  - Magicians who walk on the ground and avoid to touch any other objects
  - Wizards who fly in the air and avoid to touch any other objects
  - Worms who walk in the platform
  - Butterflies who fly along the convex hull of the structures 

- Note: 
  - you are not required to modify your agent if you do not intend to use the new optional parameter that allows to collect bird flying ground truths. <br/>
  - You can simply append a 4-byte integer with value 0 or 1 to apply the option.

### List of Changes (release alpha v0.4.2)
1. Fixed grayscale novelty (L3T6)
2. Added true novelty object ID section in the recorded Likelihood file
  - The 'true novel IDs' section records the novel object IDs in the current state

4. Fixed some null object id issue
 
### List of Changes (release alpha v0.4.1 patch)
1. Added a command argument for game_playing_interface.jar: --noisy-batch-gt

### List of Changes (release alpha v0.1) 

10th Feb 2020 

This is a brief introduction of what has been changed in this version. Please refer to the [README](https://gitlab.com/sail-on-anu/sciencebirdsframework_release/-/blob/release/alpha-0.1/README.md) file for details.

1. Speed up
    - a new protocol code is added to change the simulation speed of Unity
    - a speed of d $\in$ (0 - 50] is allowed
            - where d $\in$ (0, 1) means to slow down the simulator for 1/d times
            - d = 1 means the normal speed
            - d $\in$ (1, 50] means to speed up the simulation for d times  
    
2. The change of (noisy) groundtruth representation  
    - add trajectory points
    - change object type representation
        - object other than ground, slingshot
    - add colour distribution
3. Headless run
    - graphic-free science birds can be produced by a server build from Unity 
    - the headless run should not need any spectial command using the server build version of science birds
4. Baseline agents are added including:
    - Eagle Wings (Planning)
    - DQ agent (Deep Q learning)

5. Score changing problem after WON/LOST banner shown up is solved
6. Protocol code 13 (get best score) has been removed as it performs the same as 23 (get my score) given only one agent will play the game.
